# EU4-Siege-Solver
A Monte Carlo simulation to solve the expected siege time for the Europa Universalis 4 siege mechanic. This link explains the mechanic: https://eu4.paradoxwikis.com/Land_warfare#Sieges

## The solution
The simulation is run by 100k simulations and you can see the results in the Figures folder. It is also parametrized, so you can change the simulation parameter to change the number of simulations and try on your own. The most likely solutions for different advantage levels is also printed. Here is the output from my simulation:

```
Most likely point for winning at -4 advantage: 21.43%
Most likely point for winning at -3 advantage: 28.57%
Most likely point for winning at -2 advantage: 35.71%
Most likely point for winning at -1 advantage: 42.86%
Most likely point for winning at 0 advantage: 50.00%
Most likely point for winning at 1 advantage: 57.14%
Most likely point for winning at 2 advantage: 64.29%
Most likely point for winning at 3 advantage: 35.71%
Most likely point for winning at 4 advantage: 35.71%
Most likely point for winning at 5 advantage: 35.71%
Most likely point for winning at 6 advantage: 35.71%
Most likely point for winning at 7 advantage: 14.29%
Most likely point for winning at 8 advantage: 21.43%
Most likely point for winning at 9 advantage: 28.57%
